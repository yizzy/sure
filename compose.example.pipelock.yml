# ===========================================================================
# Example Docker Compose file with Pipelock agent security proxy
# ===========================================================================
#
# Purpose:
# --------
#
# This file adds Pipelock (https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock)
# as a security proxy for Sure, providing two layers of protection:
#
#   1. Forward proxy (port 8888) — routes outbound HTTPS through Pipelock
#      for clients that respect the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable.
#
#   2. MCP reverse proxy (port 8889) — scans inbound MCP traffic from
#      external AI assistants bidirectionally (DLP, prompt injection,
#      tool poisoning, tool call policy).
#
# Forward proxy coverage:
# -----------------------
#
# Covered (Faraday-based clients respect HTTPS_PROXY automatically):
#   - OpenAI API calls (ruby-openai gem)
#   - Market data providers using Faraday
#
# NOT covered (these clients ignore HTTPS_PROXY):
#   - SimpleFin (HTTParty / Net::HTTP)
#   - Coinbase (HTTParty / Net::HTTP)
#   - Any code using Net::HTTP or HTTParty directly
#
# For covered traffic, Pipelock provides:
#   - Domain allowlisting (only known-good external APIs can be reached)
#   - SSRF protection (blocks connections to private/internal IPs)
#   - DLP scanning on connection targets (detects exfiltration patterns)
#   - Rate limiting per domain
#   - Structured JSON audit logging of all outbound connections
#
# MCP reverse proxy coverage:
# ---------------------------
#
# External AI assistants connect to Pipelock on port 8889 instead of
# directly to Sure's /mcp endpoint. Pipelock scans all traffic:
#
#   Request scanning (client → Sure):
#     - DLP detection (blocks credential/secret leakage in tool arguments)
#     - Prompt injection detection in tool call parameters
#     - Tool call policy enforcement (blocks dangerous operations)
#
#   Response scanning (Sure → client):
#     - Prompt injection detection in tool response content
#     - Tool poisoning / drift detection (tool definitions changing)
#
# The MCP endpoint on Sure (port 3000/mcp) should NOT be exposed directly
# to the internet. Route all external MCP traffic through Pipelock.
#
# Limitations:
# ------------
#
# HTTPS_PROXY is cooperative. Docker Compose has no egress network policy,
# so any code path that doesn't check the env var can connect directly.
# For hard enforcement, deploy with network-level controls that deny all
# egress except through the proxy. Example for Kubernetes:
#
#   # NetworkPolicy: deny all egress, allow only proxy + DNS
#   egress:
#     - to:
#         - podSelector:
#             matchLabels:
#               app: pipelock
#       ports:
#         - port: 8888
#     - ports:
#         - port: 53
#           protocol: UDP
#
# Monitoring:
# -----------
#
# Pipelock logs every connection and MCP request as structured JSON to stdout.
# View logs with: docker compose logs pipelock
#
# Forward proxy endpoints (port 8888):
#   http://localhost:8888/health   - liveness check
#   http://localhost:8888/metrics  - Prometheus metrics
#   http://localhost:8888/stats    - JSON summary
#
# More info: https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock
#
# Setup:
# ------
#
# 1. Copy this file to compose.yml (or use -f flag)
# 2. Set your environment variables (OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN, MCP_API_TOKEN, etc.)
# 3. docker compose up
#
# Pipelock runs both proxies in a single container:
#   - Port 8888: forward proxy for outbound HTTPS (internal only)
#   - Port 8889: MCP reverse proxy for external AI assistants
#
# External AI clients connect to http://<host>:8889 as their MCP endpoint.
# Pipelock scans the traffic and forwards clean requests to Sure's /mcp.
#
# Customization:
# --------------
#
# Requires Pipelock with MCP HTTP listener support (--mcp-listen flag).
# See: https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock/releases
#
# Edit the pipelock command to change the mode:
#   --mode strict     Block unknown domains (recommended for production)
#   --mode balanced   Warn on unknown domains, block known-bad (default)
#   --mode audit      Log everything, block nothing (for evaluation)
#
# For a custom config, mount a file and use --config instead of --mode:
#   volumes:
#     - ./config/pipelock.yml:/etc/pipelock/config.yml:ro
#   command: ["run", "--config", "/etc/pipelock/config.yml",
#             "--mcp-listen", "0.0.0.0:8889", "--mcp-upstream", "http://web:3000/mcp"]
