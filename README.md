## Backstory

The Maybe Finance team spent most of 2021–2022 building a full-featured personal finance and wealth management app. It even included an “Ask an Advisor” feature that connected users with a real CFP/CFA — all included with your subscription.

The business end of things didn't work out, and so they stopped developing the app in mid-2023.

After spending nearly $1 million on development (employees, contractors, data providers, infra, etc.), the team open-sourced the app. Their goal was to let users self-host it for free — and eventually launch a hosted version for a small fee.

They actually did launch that hosted version … briefly.

That also didn’t work out — at least not as a sustainable B2C business — so now here we are: hosting a community-maintained fork to keep the codebase alive and see where this can go next.

Join us!

## Hosting Sure

Sure is a fully working personal finance app that can be [self hosted with Docker](docs/hosting/docker.md).
